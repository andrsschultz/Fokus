# Fokus

Fokus is a minimalistic Pomodoro timer.

The idea behind the Pomodoro Technique is to enhance focus and productivity by breaking tasks into manageable intervals. The frequent breaks help maintaining a high level of concentration during focus sessions. 

Fokus lets you tailor these work intervals and breaks to suit your workflow. Adjust timers for focused work sessions and break intervals to maintain peak productivity.

All settings are fully customizable. 

No costs.
